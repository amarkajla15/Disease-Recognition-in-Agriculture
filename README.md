# Disease-Recognition-in-Agriculture
The methodology for disease recognition in agriculture using machine learning involves several key steps. 
First, collect a diverse dataset of plant images, including healthy and diseased specimens. 
Next, preprocess the data by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images. Employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, often utilizing pre-trained models. 
Split the data into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training data, optimizing hyperparameters and employing techniques like transfer learning. 
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score. Deploy the model for real-time or batch processing, enabling farmers to detect diseases early and take informed actions, thus improving crop yield and reducing losses.
